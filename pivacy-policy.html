  <p>11. <b>Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</b></p>
  <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.</p>
  <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p><br>
  <p>0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;</p>
  <p>0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our website;</p>

  <p>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.</p>
  <p>12. <b>Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</b></p><br>
